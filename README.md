## 📡 SYSTEM TRANSMISSION
**Study-Easy** is a gamified productivity platform designed to turn the daily academic grind into a retro-futuristic mission. Built with the **MERN Stack**, it transforms standard to-do lists into "Missions," tracks habits as "Protocols," and rewards consistency with a dynamic ranking system ranging from Bronze to Platinum.

## 🕹️ CORE MODULES

### 1. 🛡️ **Mission Board (Daily Tasks)**
* **Retro Terminal UI:** A clean, pixelated interface (`VT323` font) for managing daily objectives.
* **Priority Matrices:** Classify missions as `LOW` (Purple), `MEDIUM` (Cyan), or `HIGH` (Red) priority with distinct visual cues.
* **Optimistic Updates:** Instant visual feedback (neon strikes & glows) when tasks are engaged or completed.
* **Category Tagging:** Organize by `[WORK]`, `[HEALTH]`, `[LEARNING]`, etc.

### 2. 📊 **Neural Profile (Gamification)**
* **Live Analytics:** Real-time tracking of total missions, daily completion rates, and active habits.
* **Dynamic Ranking System:** Your rank upgrades automatically based on your efficiency:
    * 🟤 **BRONZE:** < 50% Completion
    * ⚪ **SILVER:** 50% - 74%
    * 🟡 **GOLD:** 75% - 89% (Pulsing Glow)
    * 🔵 **PLATINUM:** 90%+ (High-Energy Neon Animation)
* **Data Chips:** Earn badges for milestones like "Streak Keeper" or "Task Master."

### 3. ⚡ **Habit Log**
* **Recurring Protocols:** Set habits that persist daily.
* **Sync Logic:** Habits are automatically synced to your daily task list for seamless tracking.
